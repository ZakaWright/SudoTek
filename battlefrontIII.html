    <p><p>Remember Star Wars Battlefront I and II produced by LucasArts for the Playstation 2 and Xbox? Well there was a planned Battlefront III by the same studio which was sadly canceled.  No, this isn’t the new “Star Wars: Battlefront” that was released in Fall of 2015 that was produced by Electronic Arts and developed by DICE.  This was leaked footage (provided by an anonymous 4Chan user) of the true ‘threequel’ that was intended to come after Battlefront II, and produced by the original creator, LucasArts.</p></p>
