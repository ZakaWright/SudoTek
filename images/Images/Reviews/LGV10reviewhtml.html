<h3> LG V10 Review <h3>
<h6> by Sam Tomelleri <h6>

<p>So I’ve had the V10 for over a week now, and thought it would be a good time to post my impressions of the phone. All of this is coming from a long-time Nexus fan, although I’ve had a few non-nexus phones as well.</p>
<p><strong>Build Quality/Design</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Given all of the phones I’ve had in the past two years (LG G2, Nexus 5, Xperia Z3, Nexus 6) I didn’t really expect much build-wise out of the V10.  Man was I wrong.  The phone was just impeccably built.  Even though it’s mostly plastic/rubber, it is the most solidly built phone I have ever owned.  Everything is a neater fit than what you’d find on most Android phones-I’d say this is on par, if not better than the iPhone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “Duraskin” rubber coating feels fantastic.  Gives the phone the perfect amount of grip, without collecting any dust or fingerprints. I’m not sure how they managed it, but it is unlike any other soft-touch material I’ve ever touched on any device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The stainless steel rails on the side are what makes this phone really feel so incredibly solid-and with a brushed finish, they look quite nice too.  Also, I’m pretty sure this phone would literally be the hardest to bend out of any current flagships. Shit’s solid, yo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back-mounted buttons.  I loved them when I had my G2, they were great, especially because of how natural the placement was.  On the V10, they’re even better, and I’ll get to the fingerprint sensor in a bit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Audio Quality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The built in amp and 32-bit DAC on this phone are just amazing.  The audio just sounds ever-so-slightly crisper than other phones, even when streaming music; and the amp allows your headphones to have plenty of power. (Although I’m pretty sure you’d go deaf in about 5 minutes at the max volume.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The speaker.  It’s certainly not bad, but certainly not great.  It never sounds tinny or distorted, quite clear actually.  However, that’s probably because it just doesn’t get very loud.  It would have been nice for LG to have the volume go at least a couple steps higher, even if that meant a tiny bit of shrill sounding audio at max volume. The Nexus 6 is certainly louder, but when put at a similar volume level as the V10, the V10 sounds much more clean and crisp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other- the US version of the V10 doesn’t come with those headphones you’ve seen that reviewers praised in their reviews.  Those apparently only come with the International version.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Camera</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Given it is the same sensor as the G4, you probably already know it’s fantastic.  However, it’s not perfect.  In high-contrast scenes, the brights do tend to clip.  Although, that is easily remedied by switching over to the manual mode and marking down the exposure by .5.  Details are overall quite good, but occasionally LG’s sharpening can make scenes with a lot going on look a bit off.  Compared to the Nexus 6, it’s leaps and bounds better-except for the weird “jello” effect in videos caused by the V10’s intense OIS.</li>

<ul>
<li>The front-facing cameras are both quite good.  Excellent in low light as well.  The extra wide-angle camera is a bit weird IMO, but it would definitely be nice in the right situation.</li>

<p><strong>Battery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The battery life is similar to the Nexus 6, but overall a little bit better. I have consistently been getting anywhere from 4-6 hours of SoT, with brightness most often set to ~35%, and my Urbane connected.  Typically connected to WiFi about half of the day, rest of the time on LTE.  (Wish I had a screenshot, but I forgot to take one.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The software, and that weird-ass “second” screen.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Coming from a stock-android lover, LG’s software isn’t very good.  It’s quite quick and smooth, but first, it’s ugly, and second, it’s inconsistent design-wise.  The settings menu is a mess in particular, and LG’s app icons are about 50% larger than other apps.  Dual-Window, is a feature that’s just fantastic, and I hope to see something similar come to stock android soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second screen.  I don’t get it.  Sure, it can be kind-of nice when  you can use it to control music and such, but it’s just not very convenient up on the very top of the phone.  After the first few days, I gave up on it and just disabled it.  And contrary to what many reviewers have stated- No, it’s not controlled by an independent backlight.  If you’re in a remotely dim area, it’s pretty damn obvious that the “second screen” is lighting up as well, which can be irritating when watching videos.  It’s just a larger panel with a chunk cut out of it for the cameras. I really don’t know why LG told reviewers it had a separate display controller for that part, because it really seems like it doesn’t. All it’s really doing is applying the backlight to the top-third or so of the screen when it’s off.  I really don’t get why LG didn’t go with OLED, or why they even included the thing in the first place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Screen overall</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overall, it’s a great IPS panel.  Blacks are pretty deep, colors are vibrant, and it gets quite bright outdoors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I honestly didn’t expect much out of the 808, but I was wrong.  This is quicker than the 805 on my Nexus 6, and LG’s ram management is fantastic when paired with that 4GB of RAM.  I haven’t experienced any lag or hiccups throughout any app, apart from youtube occasionally, but that’s most likely Google’s fault.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Others</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fingerprint sensor is fantastic, extremely quick and accurate.  I just hope LG goes with the native API when they update it to marshmallow so it can have more functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The packaging was quite nice, on par with Apple’s, and better than Google’s from the Nexus 6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It came with a white charger. This probably won’t bother you, but I just kinda wish I got a black charger with a black phone.  Oh well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The promotion with the free 200GB microSD Card and extra battery with a charger is just awesome. Sadly, they said it takes 4-6 weeks which is a bit irritating.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this phone is fantastic and I’d highly recommend it, there aren’t any major flaws whatsoever.</p>

<h3> Overall, the phone is a 9/10 for me. <h3>
